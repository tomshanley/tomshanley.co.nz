In 2017 I was asked to help the Service Innovation team at Department of Internal Affairs to build a visualisation of the government services and how they link to different events in people's lives.

I used [Kumu](https://kumu.io/) to build an interactive network diagram, which allowed people to explore the data from different viewpoints, such as person's life event, a government agency or a particular service. 

The final visualisation was also used as part of a presentation to the Minister of Internal Affairs.

Screenshorts of the interactive visualisation:
