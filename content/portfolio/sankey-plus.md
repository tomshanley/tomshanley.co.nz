This year I published a new library, called [Sankey Plus](https://github.com/tomshanley/sankey-plus), which improves upon my previous [Sankey Circular library](https://github.com/tomshanley/d3-sankey-circular). 

The new Sankey Plus library introduces the following new features, and was incorporates feedback and suggestions from Ralph Spandl as he integrated this libarary with Google Data Studio:

* the concept of virtual nodes and links, which allows for nice routing of links around other nodes
* arrows on the links to show direction
* a new API that allows for easy sankey generation and drawing within a specified DOM element.

You can see the new features in action in this [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@tomshanley/introducing-sankey-plus).
