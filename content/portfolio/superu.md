In 2017 I assisted Superu (The Familiies Commission) with their analysis and visualisation of data for the *Families and Whānau Status Report*.

I developed charts that helped the analysts understand their data better, and then produced final charts for inclusion in the [final published report](https://thehub.swa.govt.nz/assets/documents/F&W%202017%20report%20WEB.pdf).
