In 2017 I assisted the Ministry of Education with presenting their research on parents, caregivers and communities perceptions of school and ministry communications.

The final deliverables were a range of 10 printed posters and handouts that visualised their qualitative and quantitative analysis for a range of stakeholders.

The design incorporated Ministry of Education colour and branding, while using a sketchy aesthetic, which was made easy through the use of the [Semiotic library](https://semiotic.nteract.io/). The majority of the charts were produced using Semiotic, with some additional charts made using [RAW Graphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/).

Examples of the charts and handouts produced:

*Slope chart comparing the uptake and awareness of Communities of Learning by region*
