description : "I live and work in Christchurch, New Zealand. Originally from the UK, I am a business analyst with a particular passion for presenting data and complex information. I have over 10 years experience working in IT and government, and enjoy the challenge of analysing and presenting the complex environments in which we work. I have experience of delivering online, print and application-based data visualisations and infographics.
