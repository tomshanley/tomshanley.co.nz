I make online visualisations and maps, so that your customers can interact with and explore your data and analysis.

The visualisations I build are web-standards based, and meet accessibility and responsive needs. 

For online tools and websites, I primarilty work JavaScript, along with D3.js, ChartJS, Highcharts, Mapbox and php, and can also integrate with your tools and libraries.
