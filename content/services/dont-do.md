To save your time, these are things I don't do:
- Data science or in-depth statistical analysis. However I understand the field, and can work with your data scientist and statisticians to make their insights more easily accessibile to different audiences.
- Build or develop data warehouse systems. But I can work with your teams to define data structures, processes and ensure that the dashboards and reports built on your BI systems are easy to use and provide what people need.
