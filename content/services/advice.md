I can help your team improve the data presentation skills, either within their existing applications or learning more wider data visualisation best practice and theory.

I can work with you to tailor the best mix workshops, mentoring or one-to-one for you and your company. This training can be focussed on a particular deliverable, such helping your staff deliver a new online portal, or it take a more wider, personal development perspective.
